\mainpage Rebinner ver. 1.1
\notitle


Rebinner was designed and implemented by sns.

This section is divided into the following description pages:
<ul>
<li>Section \ref intro covers the design philosophies and ideas of the rebinner package.
<li>Section \ref install outlines the steps to compile, build and install the package.
<li>Section \ref gmesh shows examples of using rebinner package.
The examples used are based on an SNS internal geometry format - gmesh.

/** 
    \defgroup rebinner_execs Rebinner Gmesh Executables
    \brief On a user level, these above executables are the main entry points
    of the rebinner package.
    
    These executables can be used individually, but by design, they are
    intended to be used together in scripts to transform, separate, merge or
    combine, and then rebin gmesh geometry files.
    
    Please consult scripts/gmesh_correctness_test.sh for examples of running
    rebinner at different resolution and confirming correctness. The output
    should consistently be a total rebinned volume of 1.5e2 (i.e. 150). 
    
    Please consult scripts/gmesh_mthread_test.sh for examples of running
    rebinner using varying number of rebinning threads for better higher
    performance. On systems with less than 32 cores, our results show an
    almost linear speed-up.

    \brief For app developers, these above files provide "SDK" support.
    
    Application developers can use 
    \link rebinner_execs Rebinner Gmesh Executables \endlink to
    construct scripts for multi-thread/process rebinner applications, 
    as well as to develop new rebinner executables directly based on 
    \link rebinner_core Rebinner Core Functions \endlink.
