\notitle

Rebinner is a package designed by 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj">Jian Huang</a>, 
integrated by Michael Reuter, and currently used for scientific data analysis at 
<a href="http://www.sns.gov">Spallation Neutron Source</a> (SNS). 
The Rebinner package is open source, its development was entirely funded by scientific data analysis group at SNS. 
The code repo is available via the following URLs.

\code
SVN  - https://flathead.ornl.gov/repos/Binner
Trac - https://flathead.ornl.gov/trac/Binner
\endcode

Rebinner uses, and is release together with, 
two outside libraries under LGPL license. 
The Rebinner codebase keeps these libraries 
outside the main trunk of Rebinner, however.
These two libraries are:



<ul>
<li><a href="http://seelab.eecs.utk.edu/vcb.php">VCB</a> 
&mdash; a visualization cookbook library written at 
<a href="http://seelab.eecs.utk.edu/">Seelab</a> led by
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj">Jian Huang</a>.
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Libfdr/">libFDR</a>
&mdash; a basic C programming library written by 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank">James Plank</a>. 
</ul>

/** 
    \defgroup rebinner_execs Rebinner Gmesh Executables
    \brief On a user level, these above executables are the main entry points
    of the rebinner package.
    
    These executables can be used individually, but by design, they are
    intended to be used together in scripts to transform, separate, merge or
    combine, and then rebin gmesh geometry files.
    
    Please consult scripts/gmesh_correctness_test.sh for examples of running
    rebinner at different resolution and confirming correctness. The output
    should consistently be a total rebinned volume of 1.5e2 (i.e. 150). 
    
    Please consult scripts/gmesh_mthread_test.sh for examples of running
    rebinner using varying number of rebinning threads for better higher
    performance. On systems with less than 32 cores, our results show an
    almost linear speed-up.
