\notitle

Rebinner is a package designed by 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj">Jian Huang</a>, 
integrated by Michael Reuter, and currently used for scientific data analysis at 
<a href="http://www.sns.gov">Spallation Neutron Source</a> (SNS). 
The Rebinner package is open source, its development was entirely funded by scientific data analysis group at SNS. 
The code repo is available via the following URLs.

\code
SVN  - https://flathead.ornl.gov/repos/Binner
Trac - https://flathead.ornl.gov/trac/Binner
\endcode

Rebinner uses, and is release together with, 
two outside libraries under LGPL license. 
The Rebinner codebase keeps these libraries 
outside the main trunk of Rebinner, however.
These two libraries are:



<ul>
<li><a href="http://seelab.eecs.utk.edu/vcb.php">VCB</a> 
&mdash; a visualization cookbook library written at 
<a href="http://seelab.eecs.utk.edu/">Seelab</a> led by
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~huangj">Jian Huang</a>.
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~plank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Libfdr/">libFDR</a>
&mdash; a basic C programming library written by 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~plank">Jim Plank</a>. 
</ul>

For an overview of the design, we divide the description into the following pages:
<table align=center cellspacing="5" width="85%" border="0">
<tr>
<td width=150>\ref needs <td> The status-quo and the needs of having a package like Rebinner. This section also very briefly describes some physics background in layman terms. 
<tr>
<td>\ref install <td>How to compile, build and install the package.
<tr>
<td>\ref gmesh <td> Gmesh based applications using rebinner package.
Gmesh is an SNS internal geometry/mesh format. 
G for Gary, the G-user!
<tr>
<td>\ref intro <td> The design philosophies and usage examples of the rebinner package.
</table>

<hr>

Functionally speaking, the rebinner has four conceptual modules. 
They all reside under the same source tree, which is not very large. 
Please note, for scientist users, the main software development is intended to
occur on script-level, i.e to use the \ref rebinner_execs in custom
Shell or Python scripts for individually tailored analysis needs.
Those scripts are likely rather complex, depending both on the computing infrastructure
employed by the scientific analysis groups, 
as well as the setup of beam line data collection and storage.
Please contact Michael Reuter (reuterma@ornl.gov) for some real world examples. 

<table align=center cellspacing="5" width="85%" border="0">
<tr>
<td width=150>\ref rebinner_core <td> Core API. 
<tr>
<td>\ref rebinner_tests <td>Component tests of the core API.
<tr>
<td>\ref rebinner_sdk <td> Wrappers around the core API to facilitate higher level development. 
<tr>
<td>\ref rebinner_execs <td> The actual executables built for supporting gmesh analysis.

/** 
    \defgroup rebinner_execs Rebinner Executables
    \brief On a user level, these above executables are the main entry points
    of the rebinner package.
    
    These executables can be used individually, but by design, they are
    intended to be used together in scripts to transform, separate, merge or
    combine, and then rebin gmesh geometry files.
    
    Please consult scripts/gmesh_correctness_test.sh for examples of running
    rebinner at different resolution and confirming correctness. The output
    should consistently be a total rebinned volume of 1.5e2 (i.e. 150). 
    
    Please consult scripts/gmesh_mthread_test.sh for examples of running
    rebinner using varying number of rebinning threads for better higher
    performance. On systems with less than 32 cores, our results show an
    almost linear speed-up.
